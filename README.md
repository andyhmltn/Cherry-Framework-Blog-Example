Cherry Framework - Blog
=============

`This is a very light PHP MVC framework that I built for personal use to speed up client projects and 
take advantage of the MVC pattern without going overboard. The framework uses a model system that lets
you execute SQL with an active record like syntax.`

In order to show the basics of the framework I decided to create this simple blog application.

Currently left to do
------------

1. Delete/Update post actions.
2. Comment the code to show what's going on.
3. Add pagination
4. Implent a RESTful API (after it's added to Cherry)
